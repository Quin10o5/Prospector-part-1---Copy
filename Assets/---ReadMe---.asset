  - heading: 0. What is the link to your project on itch.io?
    text: https://quintenruff.itch.io/space-shmup-part-2-quinten-ruff
  - heading: 1. What are the controls to your game? How do we play?
    text: 'WASD keys to move and space bar to fire. Press on a arrow key direction
      for a quick dash with a cooldown.


      Try to shoot the enemy ships!'
  - heading: 2. What creative additions did you make? How can we find them?
    text: '1. Rebalanced and Reworked Guns

      - changed gun system to add all
      new guns to open slots, no longer wiping out guns you already collected and
      just adding them to the ships total

      2. Reworked powerups

      - when
      you have filled your ships with guns, only shield powerups will spawn, no longer
      wasting the gun ones.

      3. Added quick dash

      - press left or right
      arrow keys to do a quick dash in that direction

      - added particle system
      to show dash visually

      - added timer that shows the delay until next
      dash is available'
